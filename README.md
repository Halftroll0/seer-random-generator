Seer Random Generator is a simple plugin to generate a random fantasy name when a keyphrase is typed in the editor.

# Using Seer

To use Seer to generate a name, simply type the keyphrase `:gn` anywhere in the editor! Seer will automatically replace the keyphrase with a randomly generated name.

# Future Plans

I plan to update Seer in the future to include sci-fi names, first and last names as separate tables, place names, description generators, and more.

Ideally, Seer will be a tool for authors and gamemasters to rapidly prepare drafts or notes for running games. Sometimes you just need a placeholder name or description somewhere to be able to move on with the creative flow, and Seer will hopefully be able to help creatives with that.
